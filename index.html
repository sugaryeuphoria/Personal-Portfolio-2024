                        <p>In the tapestry of my childhood, I unwound the threads of curiosity, weaving intricate
                            patterns
                            of discovery with my very first computer that dad got us in the fourth grade. The luminous
                            screen became my portal into the enchanting realm of binary secrets, sparking a journey into
                            the
                            inner workings of science and technology. Those early hours, consumed by a voracious
                            appetite to
                            unravel the mysteries of the digital universe, forged an unbreakable bond with the world of
                            computers.</p>
                        <BR>

                        <P> I still remember I used to spend hours sitting in front of it trying to feed my insatiable
                            curiosity to understand how things worked, how space, galaxies, and planets worked, and why
                            is
                            the planet not falling off of its entire axis. My childhood tinkering sessions instilled in
                            me
                            the spirit of exploration, problem-solving, and a relentless desire to stay ahead in the
                            ever-evolving tech landscape.</P> <BR>
                        <P> Now, as a Computer Science student, I carry those childhood sparks, translating them into a
                            commitment to continuous learning and contributing meaningfully to the world we live in.
                            This
                            narrative encapsulates my journey from a curious child to a dedicated tech enthusiast,
                            showcasing my unwavering passion for science and technology.</p><BR>
