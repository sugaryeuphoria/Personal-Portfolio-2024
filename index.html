                    <p>In the tapestry of my childhood, I unwound the threads of curiosity, weaving intricate patterns
                        of discovery with my very first computer that dad got us in the fourth grade. The luminous
                        screen became my portal into the enchanting realm of binary secrets, sparking a journey into the
                        inner workings of science and technology. Those early hours, consumed by a voracious appetite to
                        unravel the mysteries of the digital universe, forged an unbreakable bond with the world of
                        computers.</p>
                    <BR>

                    <P> I still remember I used to spend hours sitting in front of it trying to feed my insatiable
                        curiosity to understand how things worked, how space, galaxies, and planets worked, and why is
                        the planet not falling off of its entire axis. My childhood tinkering sessions instilled in me
                        the spirit of exploration, problem-solving, and a relentless desire to stay ahead in the
                        ever-evolving tech landscape.</P> <BR>
                    <P> Now, as a Computer Science student, I carry those childhood sparks, translating them into a
                        commitment to continuous learning and contributing meaningfully to the world we live in. This
                        narrative encapsulates my journey from a curious child to a dedicated tech enthusiast,
                        showcasing my unwavering passion for science and technology.</p><BR>
